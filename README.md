# Project AIrys.

This is the home of my LLM-Agent AI experiment, AIrys.

With this project i want to learn and experiment while building an LLM agent that can speak, remember, and emote.

### Status

I'm 90% sure I'm going to just use Llama 3 8B quantized with qlora to base airys around, although i may pivot to using 3.2 3B in order to cut down on response time. Right now I'm leaning towards proceeding onto text-to-speech and custom ui and looping back later.
